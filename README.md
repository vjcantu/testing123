Sample notebooks while I figure this github thing out

These notebooks were some of those used while doing the processing for "SARS-CoV-2 Distribution in Residential Housing Suggests Contact Deposition and Correlates with Rothia sp." 
1) I first followed the KatharoSeq protocol to quality filter these low biomass samples. 2) The data was further pre-processed by removing certain features (single/doubletons, mitochondrial/chloroplast DNA). I also performed alpha-rarefaction and subsetted the data across various categories for downstream analyses. 3) I then performed a traditional diversity analysis and 4) forward stepwise redundancy analysis to look for variables with significant effect sizes.
